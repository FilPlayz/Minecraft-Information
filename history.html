  <h2 class="Header2">History of Minecraft</h2>
  <main>
    <p>In May 2009, Markus "Notch" Persson released the first public version of Minecraft, now known as the "Classic Minecraft".
       The game got continuous update from then on until November 2011 when it was officialy released.
       Since then the game has improved both with new graphics and new features. 
       Today minecraft is almost a completely different game compared to when it first got released, as it has visually and gameplay wise improved very much.
       In 2014, Mojang, the makers of Minecraft, was acquired by Microsoft.

    <h2 class="h2_updates">Updates</h2>
    <p class="minecraft_timline_text"><img class="minecraft_timeline" src="images/Minecraft timeline.jpg" alt="">When minecraft first got released it got updates fixing bugs, and adding new features every few months. 
      After Microsofts aquisition of Mojang the regularity of updates slowed down, to about 1 big update a year.
      Every update added lots of new features which made the game feel fresh and new, and the game still gets new big updates almost every year which adds alot to the game.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2_content_creation">Community</h2>
    <p>Content creation has played a big role in the success of Minecraft. 
      Many youtubers, and twitch streamers used to play alot of minecraft when it got first released, but at that time minecraft was a bit plain, so many people played with minecraft with mods, which added alot to the game.
      You also can't forget the importance of servers with minigames like hive with its "Survival Games" and Hypixel which is still to this day very successful.
